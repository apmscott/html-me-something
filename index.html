            <h1>Mount Rainier, Summer 2019</h1>
            <p id="intro">In summer 2019, I was a seasonal employee at <strong>Mount Rainier National Park</strong> (MORA).
            <br>Since living on a mountain isn't something I do everyday, I made a point of capturing her many faces and moods.</p>

            <header><h3>On Arrival</h3></header>
            <p>I lived in the basement of a house at Longmire, and frequently walked to a spot nearby on the Nisqually River 
                to get photos<br> from that same location thoughout my stay.</p>

            <header><h3>Evenings at the River</h3></header>
            <p>On many evenings, I would cross the historic wood suspension bridge and wander along the Nisqually River. 
                It was the <br> perfect place to find fossils, see wildlife, and watch the colors of sunset bathe the mountain. </p>

            <header><h3>Clouds Do Funky Stuff</h3></header>
            <p>It is said that the mountain makes its own weather.  At 14,410 feet, is it easy to see how this can be the case.  Lenticular clouds, <br>
                which form &quothats&quot or &quotcaps&quot over the mountain indicate that precipitation is on its way - at least in the upper elevations.</p>

            <header><h3>A View from the East</h3></header>
            <p>My projects provided many opportunities for exploring the vast wilderness, including a 3-day backpacking trip on a section of the <br>Wonderland Trail 
                in the eastern portion of the park. The peak wasn't always visible from the trail due to the layers of other towering ridges <br>and outcroppings, but when it was unmistakable when in view.</p>

            <header><h3>On the Mountain</h3></header>
            <p>Another opoprtunity: hiking to Camp Muir, the stopping point before summiting! Starting from Paradise, we hiked to Camp Muir,<br> a collection of rock and wood shelters 
            for rangers, guides, and climbers, barely visible in the background beyond the hikers.<br>  A new highest elevation for me: 10,110 ft. </p>

            <header><h3>Bushwacking from the West</h3></header>
            <p>A last-minute project came up late in my season, which required us to access an 
            area along the Wonderland Trail on the west side <br> of the park. We only had enough time for an overnight, so we 
            cut through the forest from lumber company property. </p>

            <header><h3>To the End, My Friend</h3></header>
            <p>As my season neared the end, the weather became less cooperative. Rain was common and the Mountain was generally more socked in. <br> 
            Was she pouting because I was leaving? Perhaps. 
            I know I was. But, I'll be back someday... </p>
